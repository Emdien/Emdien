## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Gonzalo! Known more as Emdien or MdN. 

:mortar_board: I'm a graduate in Software Engineering at University of Murcia. I've been incredibly passionate about technology ever since I was a kid, and particularly started showing a lot of interest for programming when I was around 16 years old. Currently I've been learning how to code stuff for about 6 to 7 years.

- :computer: My strongest languages or the ones I'm more confident on right now are Java and JavaScript, although I've got my fair share of experience with Python, C and C++

- :books: For languages that I'm currently learning or gaining experience, I'd say its mostly JavaScript/TypeScript and Python, while also checking C# every now and then

- :mag: I'm mostly interested on working at "backend" related stuff, but I also enjoy some frontend. Particularly got some experience with web development and REST APIs

- :test_tube: Learning React for frontend web development, while learning a bit of Flask to manage backend

- :pencil2: A lot of my repos were done during my CS degree or are mostly toys, so they will most definetly have plenty of issues especially if they are old repos.

Finished my final proyect, which is publicly available. It consists on a CI module for ontology quality evaluation which uses OQuaRE framework to obtain them. Most likely gonna focus on progressing the development of the devblog + maybe some other fancy stuff that I might feel like doing.
