## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Gonzalo! Known more as Emdien or MdN. 

:mortar_board: I'm currently a Computer Science student at University of Murcia, and got the plans of finishing the degree this year. I've been incredibly passionate about technology ever since I was a kid, and particularly started showing a lot of interest for programming when I was around 16 years old. Currently I've been learning how to code stuff for about 6 to 7 years.

- :computer: My strongest languages or the ones I'm more confident on right now are Java and JavaScript, although I've got my fair share of experience with Python, C and C++

- :books: For languages that I'm currently learning or gaining experience, I'd say its mostly JavaScript/TypeScript and Python, while also checking C# every now and then

- :mag: I'm mostly interested on working at "backend" related stuff, but I also enjoy some frontend. Particularly got some experience with web development and API REST

- :test_tube: Currently learning React as a frontend library for web development. Also interested in learning Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, but severely lacking experience.
- :pencil2: It's important to note that most if not all of my current public repositories are simply toys that were made for different courses of the CS degree. Most of them are in a state where I can show them withouth being ashamed, but they will most likely have some glaring issues as they were made as I was learning. Most likely doesn't represent my current level or knowledge!

At the moment I'm working on the final project for my degree, which in my case is making a CI workflow using GitHub Actions to automatize the calculation of metrics of ontologies in repositories using the OQuaRE framework.
