## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Gonzalo! Known more as Emdien or MdN. 

:mortar_board: I'm currently a Computer Science student at University of Murcia, and got the plans of finishing the degree this year. I've been incredibly passionate about technology ever since I was a kid, and particularly started showing a lot of interest for programming when I was around 16 years old. Currently I've been learning how to code stuff for about 6 to 7 years.

- :books: For languages that I'm currently learning or gaining experience, I'd say its mostly JavaScript/TypeScript and Python, while also checking C# every now and then

- :mag: I'm mostly interested on working at "backend" related stuff, but I also enjoy some frontend. Particularly got some experience with web development and API REST

- :test_tube: Currently learning React for a frontend library for web development. Also interested in learning Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, but severely lacking experience.
